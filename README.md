### 👋 Hi, I'm Esther Farré Gutiérrez  
🎓 **Pedagogue** | 💻 **LMS Specialist** | 🌍 Based in **Barcelona** | 👩‍🏫 Working at **IT Academy**

I'm passionate about **technology**, **digital learning**, and making knowledge accessible to everyone — even though I'm not a developer myself.  
I specialize in **Learning Management Systems (LMS)** and love creating learning environments that empower people to grow.  

🧠 I believe that **education + tech = opportunity** 🚀  

🎮 In my free time, you’ll probably find me **playing video games**, **reading**, **doing sports** — or sometimes just **doing absolutely nothing** 😌. I think balance is everything.
