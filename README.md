### 👋 Hi, I'm Esther Farré Gutiérrez  
🎓 **Pedagogue** | 💻 **LMS Specialist** | 🌍 Based in **Barcelona** | 👩‍🏫 Working at **IT Academy**

I'm passionate about **technology**, **digital learning**, and making knowledge accessible to everyone — even though I'm not a developer myself.  
I specialize in **Learning Management Systems (LMS)** and love creating learning environments that empower people to grow.  

🕹️ In my free time, you'll probably find me enjoying a good **video game** — I love how interactive worlds can tell powerful stories and spark creativity.  

I believe that **education + tech = opportunity** 🚀
